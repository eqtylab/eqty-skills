# eqty-lineage-langchain

EQTY lineage callback handler for LangChain and LangGraph. Registers graph nodes, chat model calls, and tool calls as
EQTY data assets and computation statements, threaded together into one end-to-end lineage flow:

- every graph node run → input/output Dataset assets + a computation statement
- every chat model call → Prompt + Model assets, normalized request/response Documents, and a Reasoning output
- every tool call → Tool + input Dataset in, output Dataset out + computation
- every retrieval → Tool + query Prompt in, one Document asset per retrieved document out
- every subagent → its own `agent` computation, linked to the tool that delegated to it

## Usage

```python
from eqty_lineage.langchain import EqtyCallbackHandler

app.invoke(state, config={"callbacks": [EqtyCallbackHandler()]})
```

Only `langchain-core` is required at runtime, so the handler works with plain LangChain runnables as well as LangGraph
graphs. Use one handler instance per invocation.

When a compatible client adds `eqty_openai_request_payload` to its final response metadata, the handler records that
payload as an OpenAI-request Document and links it from the normalized LangChain request with a `ChatOpenAI XForm`
computation. That payload is RFC 8785 (JCS) canonicalized, then given a raw-binary CID so it can join the current
vNIM `Request Body` representation. `ChatEqtyVnimOpenAI` provides this metadata automatically.

### Session isolation

Set the application/tenant root context once when initializing the SDK. The handler automatically creates
and reuses one child context per LangGraph `thread_id`; every asset and statement from that thread is
recorded beneath that child. A `run_id` identifies one execution, not a multi-turn user session.

```python
root_context = Context.new("my-agent")
eqty_sdk.init(default_context=root_context)

app.invoke(
    state,
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": conversation_id}, "callbacks": [EqtyCallbackHandler()]},
)
```

Use one handler instance per invocation. The thread-context cache is shared by handlers in the process, so
later turns of the same `thread_id` reuse its child context.

After an invocation, export that handler's thread context—not the SDK root—to retrieve only that chat's
lineage manifest:

```python
handler = EqtyCallbackHandler()
app.invoke(state, config={"configurable": {"thread_id": conversation_id}, "callbacks": [handler]})
handler.context.export("manifests/conversation.json")
```

### Optional Integrity Service registration

Pass `integrity_service_url` when constructing the handler to register the active EQTY context after **every
top-level graph invocation**. This is intentionally per call, not per LangGraph thread/session, so each chat turn is
available to the service as soon as it completes. The SDK resolves the service credential only from `EQTY_API_KEY`.

```python
handler = EqtyCallbackHandler(
    integrity_service_url="https://integrity.example.com",
)
app.invoke(state, config={"callbacks": [handler], "configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}})
```

## `verbose` — extra metadata on assets

```python
EqtyCallbackHandler(verbose=True)
```

By default each asset carries only its name and description. With `verbose=True`, every registered asset also gets the
raw LangChain callback context as metadata: which callback produced it (`callback`), the `run_id` and `parent_run_id`,
`tags`, the LangGraph `metadata` dict, and any other keyword arguments the callback received.

Values are sanitized before they reach the SDK so they render correctly in the graph explorer (which displays each
metadata value as a string):

- non-JSON types (`UUID`, `Path`, messages, ...) are converted to strings automatically — no need to pre-stringify `run_id`
- dicts and lists are JSON-encoded (otherwise they'd display as  `[object Object]`)
- `None` is kept and encoded as the string `"null"`, so a present-but-empty key is distinguishable from an absent one
- keys that collide with the SDK's own constructor kwargs (`name`, `description`, ...) are prefixed with `LC-`
(e.g. the LangChain run name appears as `LC-name`)

## `@eqty_tool` — capture tool source code

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from eqty_lineage.langchain import eqty_tool


@tool
@eqty_tool
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the knowledge base."""
    ...
```

Decorating a tool function with `@eqty_tool` records its Python source code at definition time (callbacks only receive
the tool's *name* at runtime, so the source cannot be recovered later). When the tool is first called, the handler
registers its Tool asset **from the source code itself** — mirroring how `@eqty_sdk.compute` registers a code asset for
the function it wraps — so the asset's CID is content-addressed to the implementation: edit the tool's code and the
next run produces a new Tool asset, making it visible in the lineage which version of the code each computation used.

Notes:

- the decorator returns the function unchanged and works on either side of LangChain's `@tool`
- tools without the decorator still get a Tool asset, registered from a name/description stub instead of source
- source capture uses `inspect.getsource`, so it only works for functions defined in real files
(not a REPL or `exec`'d code); the tool's registered source includes its decorator lines
- the registry is module-level state, so a handler imported as a separate module object has its own copy —
`examples/langchain/diff_demo.py` registers its tools against whichever handler module it is about to run,
rather than decorating them once at import time

## What identifies a model, a tool, a retriever

Each is content-addressed to what identifies it, not merely to its name — otherwise two things that behave
differently share one asset.

**Models** carry their sampling parameters from `invocation_params`, so a call at `temperature=1.9` is a
different asset from one at `temperature=0.0`. Bound tool schemas are excluded (the tool belt is the agent's
shape, and each tool is its own asset already), as is anything whose name reads as credential material —
matched on whole words, so `max_completion_tokens` survives and `auth_token` does not.

**Tools** keep the source-as-payload shape when nothing is attached. Attach configuration and the payload
becomes a mapping carrying the source alongside it, so one tool name pointed at staging and at production is
two assets.

**Retrievers** fold in whatever you attach, because a class name alone cannot tell two corpora apart.

For all three, anything you attach with `with_config` is folded in:

```python
retriever.with_config(run_name="legal-index", metadata={"index": "pinecone://legal-v3"})
model.with_config(tags=["prod"], metadata={"deployment": "eu-west"})
```

The frameworks' own run-scoped keys are excluded, since folding them in would mint a new asset on every call
rather than identify the thing invoked: `langgraph_*`, `ls_*`, `lc_*` and `checkpoint_ns` in metadata, and
`seq:step:N`, `graph:step:N`, `map:key:*`, `langsmith:*` in tags — those last encode a *position*, so keeping
them would give the same tool a different asset depending on where in the graph it was called.

## What lands on each computation

Every computation statement carries a `framework` tag, read from the run's own metadata rather than assumed:
LangSmith's `ls_integration` when the harness sets it (`deepagents`, `langchain_create_agent`), `langgraph` when the run
carries `langgraph_*` metadata, and `langchain` otherwise. The root computation is named after the agent's
`lc_agent_name` when there is one, so a named agent no longer shows up as `LangGraph`.

Failures are recorded rather than dropped. A node, tool or model call that raises produces a computation with
`computation_type` of `graph_node_error`, `tool_error` or `chat_model_error` and a Dataset output holding the error type
and message. A failed tool's error also feeds the enclosing node's output state, because that is what the model sees.

Work nested inside a tool — a model call, another chain — is linked to the tool's result, and a node that returns `None`
(as LangChain middleware does to mean "no state update") is still recorded, scoped to that node so unrelated middleware
nodes do not collapse onto one shared entity.

LangGraph `Command` results are unwrapped rather than stringified, so the state update a tool applied — including files a
DeepAgents subagent wrote via `task` — stays structured and its `Path` values are still collected.

## Subagents

A subagent's root run carries its own name but inherits `langgraph_node` from the tool that spawned it, so it matches
neither the node rule nor the root rule. It is detected instead by its `lc_agent_name` differing from its parent's —
LangChain's own rule, from `langchain.agents._subagent_transformer` — and recorded with `computation_type` of `agent`.
Its final state feeds the tool that delegated to it, so DeepAgents' `task` no longer appears to produce its result from
nothing. A plain subgraph inherits the parent's name and is not a boundary.

## Retrievals

`on_retriever_start` / `on_retriever_end` register the retriever as a `Tool`, the query as a `Prompt`, and **each
retrieved document as its own `Document` asset** — one per document rather than one per result set, so the same
document retrieved by two different queries is recognisably the same entity. Each document asset carries the
document's own `metadata`, which is where per-document provenance normally lives (`source`, page, chunk id), and is
named from `metadata["source"]` when present. For a RAG chain this is the provenance that matters most.

The retriever's own asset is content-addressed to its **identity**, not just its class name — a class name alone
cannot tell two corpora apart. Whatever you attach with `with_config` is folded in:

```python
retriever.with_config(run_name="legal-index", metadata={"index": "pinecone://legal-v3"})
```

- `retriever` — what this run called it (`run_name` when set, otherwise the class)
- `class` — from LangSmith's `ls_retriever_name`, stable even when `run_name` renames the run
- `config` — the metadata you attached, minus the frameworks' own run-scoped keys (`langgraph_*`, `ls_*`, `lc_*`,
`checkpoint_ns`), which would otherwise mint a new asset on every call
- `tags` — any tags you attached

So the same wrapper class aimed at two indexes registers as two assets, and the manifest records *which* corpus was
consulted. Nothing is required: an un-configured retriever still gets an asset, just a less specific one.

## `StateExtractor` — teaching the handler about your state

```python
from eqty_lineage.langchain import UNCLAIMED, EqtyCallbackHandler, StateExtractor


class FilesExtractor(StateExtractor):
    def extract(self, key_path, value, sink):
        if key_path != ("files",):
            return UNCLAIMED
        for path, data in value.items():
            asset = Dataset.from_object(data, name=path, **sink.metadata)
            sink.create(asset.cid)
        return {"extracted": sorted(value)}


handler = EqtyCallbackHandler()
handler.add_extractor(FilesExtractor())
```

By default everything a state holds is serialized into that node's state Dataset, every time — so a filesystem carried
in state is embedded once per node, and no file is ever an entity in its own right. An extractor claims part of a
state, registers whatever assets represent it, and returns what stands in its place in the payload.

- `key_path` is the sequence of dict keys that led to the value, so an extractor claims a particular state key rather
than guessing from the value's shape
- `sink.carry(cid)` for an entity that already existed (an input); `sink.create(cid)` for one this computation produced
(an output). Never both — re-emitting a carried asset as an output puts a cycle in the graph
- `sink.metadata` is the sanitized verbose metadata, ready to unpack into an SDK asset constructor
- extractors are consulted in registration order, newest first, so yours beats the built-in `PathExtractor`
- an extractor that raises is skipped rather than taking down the run being observed

## `Path` values in graph state

`pathlib.Path` values in graph state get special treatment: if the path exists, the file or directory is registered as
its own Dataset asset via `Dataset.from_path` (CIDing full directory contents) and linked into the computation that
carried it. Keep filesystem references in state as `Path` objects rather than strings to opt in.

Versions are keyed on `(path, content CID)`, not on the path alone, so a file rewritten partway through a run is a
distinct entity from the one registered earlier:

- **new content at a known path** — a new Dataset asset, recorded as an *output* of the computation that wrote it, with
  the version it replaced linked as an *input*. Successive edits form a chain rather than unrelated assets.
- **content already registered** — carried through as an *input*, never re-emitted as an output (which would put a cycle
  in the graph).

Keying on the path alone would resolve every later sighting to the first one's asset, so any computation running after a
rewrite would be attested against content it never saw.

## Demo: what the lineage looks like before and after

```bash
just langchain-diff-demo                                 # working tree vs. the newest release tag
just langchain-diff-demo eqty-lineage-langchain@0.0.1    # ...or any ref you name
```

Runs one identical document-review agent twice — once through the handler at the baseline ref, once through
the working tree — and writes `manifests/before.json` and `manifests/after.json`. The model is scripted rather
than live, so the two runs are byte-identical and every difference in the manifest is attributable to the
handler alone.

The baseline defaults to the newest `eqty-lineage-langchain@*` tag, so this keeps answering "what changed
since the last release" as releases are cut, rather than freezing into a comparison against one fixed version.
Rows that differ are marked `*`; a run against an unchanged baseline marks nothing.

Every row is a property of the lineage and is stable run to run. The manifest's raw statement and asset
counts are deliberately not reported: assets are content-addressed, so two state payloads that happen to
coincide collapse into one registration and the totals move by one between otherwise identical runs.

Rows that differ are marked `*`. Because the baseline tracks the newest tag, the table shows what has changed
since the last release — against `0.0.2`:

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| computations recorded | 14 | 16 |
| retrievals recorded | 0 | 1 |
| documents registered | 0 | 2 |
| subagents recorded | none | `specialist` |
| computation kinds | `chat_model`, `graph`, `graph_node`, `tool`, `tool_error` | plus `agent`, `retriever` |
| orphaned node outputs | `assess` | none |

Name any ref to compare further back — `just langchain-diff-demo eqty-lineage-langchain@0.0.1` reaches the
release before the correctness work, which is what these screenshots show:
